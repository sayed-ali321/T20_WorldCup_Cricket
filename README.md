##T20 World Cup Cricket Data Analyst Project
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing data from the ICC T20 World Cup Cricket tournaments. The goal is to provide insights into player performances, team strategies, and overall trends in the tournament history. By utilizing various data analysis techniques and visualizations, we aim to answer key questions and uncover hidden patterns in the T20 World Cup data.

Objective
Analyze historical T20 World Cup data to gain insights into team and player performance.
Identify trends, correlations, and key metrics that influence match outcomes.
Visualize the data to provide clear, actionable insights for cricket fans, analysts, and teams.
Dataset
The dataset contains information from the ICC T20 World Cup tournaments, including:

Match results (team names, scores, winner/loser, etc.)
Player statistics (runs, wickets, batting average, bowling economy, etc.)
Team statistics (total runs, total wickets, boundary rates, etc.)
Year-wise data of T20 World Cup tournaments
Analysis Techniques
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Clean and process the dataset to identify key trends, distributions, and correlations.
Statistical Analysis: Use statistical tests to evaluate player and team performance metrics.
Data Visualization: Create graphs and dashboards (using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn) to represent performance patterns and trends.
Tools & Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas (Data manipulation)
NumPy (Numerical operations)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data visualization)
SQL (For querying and data extraction from relational databases)
Data Storage: CSV, Excel, or SQL databases (depending on the source of data)
Features
Player Performance Analysis: Analyze the top players of each tournament, including batting, bowling, and overall performance.
Team Performance: Explore the performance of various teams over the years and identify successful strategies.
Match Insights: Identify the key factors that determine the outcome of matches, such as batting first vs. chasing, player form, and weather conditions.
Interactive Dashboards: Generate interactive visualizations and reports for easy interpretation of data trends.
